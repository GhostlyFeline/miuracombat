# Mermaid Combat Simulation
Mermaid Combat Simulation by GhostlyFeline

This is my interpretation of the systems and mechanics of Miuratale's combat system, with a focus on fast and responsive action gameplay.  It uses mostly recycled assets from my own projects, with a few custom ones to better match the look of Miuratale's UI.

Most of the rpg mechanics have been either omitted or faked for the purposes of quick prototyping.  The idea isn't to reconstruct the entire game (I don't have time and it would feel disrespectful to do so), but rather to brainstorm ideas, and get the flow of combat feeling good and fun.

This prototype has been built primarily with gamepad controls in mind.  Some of the keyboard/mouse functionality is currently missing.

Gamepad Controls (Xbox Configuration):
* Left Stick - Move
* A - Shoot
* B - Dolphin Dash (Full i-frames during dash)
* X - Breaker

* Right Bumper - Switch Target
* Left Trigger - Element Wheel (Right stick to choose)
* Right Trigger - Skill Wheel (Right stick to choose)

* P - Start the battle scene from the beginning.
* O - Cancel the current battle.
