# Mermaid Combat Simulator
Mermaid Combat Simulator by GhostlyFeline

This is my interpretation of the systems and mechanics of Miuratale's combat system, with a focus on fast and responsive action gameplay.

Most of the rpg mechanics have been either omitted or faked for the purposes of quick prototyping.  The idea isn't to reconstruct the entire game (I don't have time and it would feel disrespectful to do so), but rather to brainstorm ideas, and get the flow of combat feeling good and fun.

This prototype has been built primarily with gamepad controls in mind.  Some of the keyboard/mouse functionality is currently missing.

Gamepad Controls (Xbox Configuration):
* Left Stick - Move
* A - Shoot
* B - Dolphin Dash (Full i-frames during dash)
* X - Charge/Release Spell (Tap to use Breaker)
* Y - Skill (Only Siren Song currently available, but can be powered up to Lv 3 with repeated use)
* Right Bumper - Switch Target
* Left Trigger - Select Element (Right stick to choose)

Debug Controls (Keyboard):
* P - Start the battle scene from the beginning.
* O - Cancel the current battle.
